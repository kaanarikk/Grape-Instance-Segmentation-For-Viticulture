# Grape-Instance-Segmentation-For-Viticulture
In this dataset, using a unique dataset (FGVL Dataset) collected from Sultana seedless grape vineyards in the Aegean Region of Turkey, an example segmentation model has been developed to classify frost-damaged leaves and grape clusters at the pixel level.
The dataset includes 418 frost-damaged grapes, 510 frost-damaged leaves, 395 healthy grapes, and 698 healthy leaves, collected after a severe frost event in April 2025 at a vineyard in Manisa. The im-ages were captured in high resolution under natural lighting conditions and manually labeled by experts.

# Instructions

Participants must use the FGVL Dataset to develop deep learning models for instance segmentation of frost-damaged and healthy grape leaves and clusters.

You are free to use any image processing or deep learning framework (e.g., YOLOv11, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and apply data augmentation, model tuning, and evaluation techniques.

Submissions will be evaluated based on mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 metrics on the test set.
